# Set Up The Project
1. ##Import Projects##
   
   Only import the following projects:
   - ABS
   - PullToRefresh
   - SlidingMenu
   - SplashActivity (this is actually the main project, just named poorly)
   

2. ##Verify Target Versions##

   Each library project should hit a target greater than or equal to 2.3, but the libraries should actully probably target the highest available Google Library version.  the primary project should target the latest version but should have a minimum version of about 2.3.3.
   
3. ##Run On Device/Emulator##

   To verify the project structure, run on an emulator with a version above 2.3.3 or an actual device.
